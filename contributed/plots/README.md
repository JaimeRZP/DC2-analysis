# This is the directory that will contain the plots you make with DC2 data


Ideally the plots are produced from a notebook/code submitted in the directory, however you can also submit a plot on its own into this directory. In addition to the plot, you should submit text (e.g. a long figure caption) that describes the science case and pipeline and accompanies the figure.

In order to submit the figure/text, you can follow the same procedure as for submitting the analysis notebooks (repeated from the README one level up):


Here are the instructions to contribute your plots to this repo.

If you are an experienced git user, the TL;DR is:
- Checkout a new branch.
- Put your plot into `contributed/plots`
- Commit, push, and submit a PR.

Otherwise, follow the step-by-step guide outlined in [`contributed/README.md`](../README.md), but, instead of checking in notebooks, checking in your plots and descriptions.
