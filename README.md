# DC2-analysis

The repository contains general analysis scripts for the DC2 simulated dataset.  Project-specific work can be done in separate repositories, but some analysis tasks will be generally useful, and the relevant scripts and notebooks can be included here for more general consumption.

# Links

The [DC2-production repository](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/DC2-production) includes documents, discussion, and scripts related to the production and validation of DC2.  Please go there for more information.

If you find some problem or have a question about tutorials and scripts in this repository, please ask by [opening an issue](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/DC2-analysis/issues).

# How to get involved

In the [tutorials directory](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/DC2-analysis/tree/master/tutorials) you can find a set of well-documented tutorials that show how to access and use DC2 data in a variety of ways.  The [README](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/DC2-analysis/tree/master/tutorials/README.rst) in that directory has a table describing the tutorials.

TBD: Something needs to be said here about the contributed directory once it exists and has a README that says how to contribute new material, but there is nothing to link to yet.

# Questions?

If the links above don't do the job, please [open an issue](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/DC2-analysis/issues) with your question.  Alternatively, the #desc-dc2-users channel on the LSSTC slack is a good place to talk with others who are analyzing DC2 data.
